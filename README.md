# Overview

I know what I want to do but I don't know how to do it. :) So, I am at a loss as to how to get this done but I know I am close. I have started over twice and refactored the whole thing twice and I simply do not have any more time to dedicate to this project. I am behind one whole week and I am scrambling to keep up. I do not have the time for a tutor and I cannot sit and dedicate the amount of time I need to work through it. I only get an hour here or an hour and a half there. By the time I pick it up again I need to re-learn what I was doing...and then I have to leave it for other obligations. 

This is quite a challenge.

But I got this far. :)

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
